# STILL Blockchain
Copyright (c) 2025 The Still Project. All rights reserved.

STILL is the world's first MiniDAG, a novel system that simulates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) on a linear blockchain.  
STILL will be fairly launched and secured by multi-chain Proof-of-Work via Merge-Mining.

## Current phase
The STILL Blockchain is under active development. The current phase is "local testnet": there *will* be frequent breaking changes, as such there is no public network yet, but you can run the STILL node locally and operate your own private testnet.
A public testnet will be set up when the protocol has reached a partial stability.
The mainnet is expected around June or July 2025.
